## Introduction
The aim of the Push_swap proyect is to implement a sorting algorithm. At our disposal, we have a set of non-repeating int values, two stacks(A,B) and limited instructions to manipulate 
both stacks:

## Push_swap example
Here there's an example to illustrate the effect of these instructions. The numbers to be sorted can be given to the push_swap executable as arguments in two ways: as a set
of numbers (``./push_swap 2 1 3 6 5 8 ``) or as a string of numbers separated by a space (``./push_swap "2 1 3 6 5 8"``).
```
$> ./push_swap 2 1 3 6 5 8
 
 Init a and b   Exec sa     Exec pb pb pb     Exec rr      Exec rrr       Exec sa      Exec pa pa pa
 
 2                1                                                                       1
 1                2                                                                       2
 3                3                                                                       3
 6                6            6   3           5    2        6    3        5     3        5
 5                5            5   2           8    1        5    2        6     2        6
 8                8            8   1           6    3        8    1        8     1        8
---  ---         ---  ---     ---  ---        ---  ---      ---  ---      ---   ---      ---  ---
 a    b           a    b       a    b          a    b        a    b        a     b        a    b
Number of instructions : 10
```
The output of this program is the set of instructions needed to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a:
```
$> ./push_swap 2 1 3 6 5 8
 sa
 pb
 pb
 pb
 rr
 rrr
 sa
 pa
 pa
 pa
```

## My sorting algorithm

:footprints: Step 1: Parse numbers

We have to check if the arguments are digits, if they are not repeated and if they are integers (n âˆˆ [-21474836478 2147483647]). If they meet all this requirements, they are put in stack A, a linked list where the void * content is casted to a int after allocating memory for a int. 
```
typedef struct s_list
{
	void			*content;
	struct s_list	*next;
}					t_list;	
```
Let's see a simple example of how to work with an integer and this linked list:
```
t_list *example;
int     n;

n = 3;
example = malloc(sizeof(t_list));
example->content = malloc(sizeof(int));
*(int *)example->content = n;
printf("content %d\n",*(int *)example->content); --> 3
```

:footprints: Step 2: Apply 2 or 3 numbers sorting algorithm

If the length of the stack A is 2 or 3 the numbers are sorted regarding the position of the minimum and the maximum number in the stack.
Otherwise go to step 3.

:footprints: Step 3: Label numbers from 0 to length of the stack A

In order to avoid working with negative numbers, we turn them into positive ones. This requires sorting the numbers in an array and matching every number with the position (index) of that number in the sorted array. Let's see an example:
```
./push_swap 4 3 -1 5

array_0 = [4,3,-1,5] //initial array
array_1 = [-1,3,4,5] // sorted array
array_2 = [2,1,0,3] // numbers we are going to work with
```

:footprints: Step 4: Apply 4 or 5 numbers sorting algorithm
This algorithm is about moving to the top of stack A the minimum number and pushing it to stack B until there`s only 3 numbers in stack A. This is the moment whem the algorithm to sort 3 numbers gets back in the game. 
Otherwise, go to step 5.
